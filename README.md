# Introduction

While I was playing 2048, I thought that what move could be the best move in each stage?

And I started looking for such a resource in GitHub, but I didn't find what I wanted.

So i start this project base on [gabrielecirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) project to find best move in each stage!.
